# Facial Recognition System Using FaceNet
1. Overview
Develop a real-time facial recognition system using the FaceNet architecture. The system will detect, align, and identify faces from images or video streams, producing 128-dimensional embeddings for each face and matching them against a database for verification or identification.

2. Dataset Information
Primary Dataset: VGGFace2 (for training and benchmarking)

Over 3.3 million images of 9,000+ identities

High variability in pose, age, illumination, ethnicity, and profession

Benchmark Dataset: Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) for evaluation

13,000 images of faces collected from the web

Used for measuring verification accuracy

Data Format: RGB images, variable sizes, labeled by identity

3. Libraries & Tools
Python 3.x

PyTorch or TensorFlow (deep learning framework)

OpenCV (image processing and face detection)

dlib or MTCNN (face alignment)

NumPy (data manipulation)

scikit-learn (metrics)

Flask or FastAPI (API deployment)

Docker (containerization)

4. Functional Requirements
Detect and align faces in images or video streams

Generate 128-dimensional embeddings for each detected face

Compare embeddings for verification (1:1) and identification (1:N)

Achieve >99% accuracy on LFW benchmark

Provide a REST API for face registration, verification, and identification

Support batch processing and real-time inference

Ensure privacy and security of stored embeddings
