# Facial Recognition System Using FaceNet
## 1. Overview
  Develop a real-time facial recognition system using the FaceNet architecture. The system will detect, align, and identify faces from images or video streams, producing 128-dimensional embeddings for each face and matching them against a database for verification or identification.

## 2. Dataset Information
* Primary Dataset: VGGFace2 (for training and benchmarking)

  * Over 3.3 million images of 9,000+ identities

  * High variability in pose, age, illumination, ethnicity, and profession

* Benchmark Dataset: Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) for evaluation

  * 13,000 images of faces collected from the web

  * Used for measuring verification accuracy

* Data Format: RGB images, variable sizes, labeled by identity

## 3. Libraries & Tools
* Python 3.x

* PyTorch or TensorFlow (deep learning framework)

* OpenCV (image processing and face detection)

* dlib or MTCNN (face alignment)

* NumPy (data manipulation)

* scikit-learn (metrics)

* Flask or FastAPI (API deployment)

* Docker (containerization)

## 4. Functional Requirements
* Detect and align faces in images or video streams

* Generate 128-dimensional embeddings for each detected face

* Compare embeddings for verification (1:1) and identification (1:N)

* Achieve >99% accuracy on LFW benchmark

* Provide a REST API for face registration, verification, and identification

* Support batch processing and real-time inference

* Ensure privacy and security of stored embeddings

* Implement efficient search and matching algorithms (cosine similarity)

<b>5. API Development</b>

* Develop REST API for face registration, verification, and identification

* Add endpoints for batch processing and real-time video stream handling

<b>6. Performance Optimization</b>

* Quantize and optimize model for faster inference

* Implement multi-threading or GPU acceleration

<b>7. Security & Privacy</b>
